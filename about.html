I am Akanksha Shrivastava, and am a Computer Science enthusiast, currently working as an Analytics Specialist at Opera Solutions. I graduated from <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" rel="nofollow">Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</a>, with a degree in B.Arch. in June 2013. I finished my higher secondary education from <a href="http://dpsbhilai.in/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Delhi Public School, Bhilai</a>.

I have been interested in Artificial Intelligence since my first summer project on image matching at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Currently at Opera Solutions, I use statistics and machine learning algorithms to solve business problems everyday.

I plan to pursue a Masters in Computer Science from Fall 2014. Kindly follow my <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/akankshashriviitkgp/workex">professional</a> page for further information on my interests. As a hobby, I also like solving puzzles and the book 'Algorithmic Puzzles' by Anany Levitin and Maria Levitin helped me understand algorithmic thinking and problem solving through specific examples.

<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Aside my professional interests,</strong> I listen to a lot of rock and country music, and old Hindi classics. I read a lot of classic literature - 1984 and Wuthering Heights being my favorites. To give a vent to my creativity, I paint occasionally and participate in dramatics. I also love to travel, and see new places.</div>
