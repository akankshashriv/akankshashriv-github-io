<a href="thesis">Query Answering in Semantic Web : Modeling User Preferences using Possibilistic Networks</a>
<p>In order to answer queries in the context of Semantic web, ontologies enable us to map web-pages to a knowledge  base  and thus add  meaning  and  structure  to  the data, allowing automated reasoning operations on the data. Description Logics (eg Datalog) are a powerful yet tractable tool to accomplish this. My work focuses on incorporating user preferences while generating ranked answers for Conjunctive queries and handling uncertainty.</p>
