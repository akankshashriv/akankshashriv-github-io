<h3>Semantic Web and Probabilistic Ontologies</h3>
<p>
In  the  context  of  Semantic  Web,  ontologies  play an important role by automating the exploitation of  vast  data  available  to  us.   Ontologies  are  rich conceptual schemas that provide us with standards for data sharing and integration. Currently, the web comprises of lots of information accessible  by  means  of  keywords  associations  and link  navigation.   While  extracting  lots  of  relevant data  by  means  of  a  search  engine  is  quite  easy because  of  the  simplicity  of  the  structure  of  the Web, it's a lot harder to retrieve the "most" relevant information,  relevance  being  measured  in  terms of  complexity,  vagueness  and  ambiguity  and  the level  of  description  of  the  queries.   This  is  where ontologies in the semantic web come into play.
</p>

<p>Ontologies enable us to map webpages to a knowledge  base  and  add  meaning  and  structure  to  the data, allowing automated reasoning operations on the data using the knowledge bases.  The knowledge base acquired by simple mapping processes can befurther enriched by deductions and inductions using logic.  While simpler queries can be handled by firstorder logic, we use descriptive logic languages like DL-Lite when more expressibility is needed.  Most reasoning tasks are tractable and can be performedin polynomial time, and even the data complexity is manageable being LOGSPACE.</p>

<p>To handle uncertainty and vagueness in query answering, one can introduce probabilities in the ontology. Once webpages are annotated with probabilistic events  (rather  than  straightforward  axioms),  the tasks  that  can  be  performed  thus  are  expressing vague concepts, data processing over probabilistic uncertainty,  ranking  and  conjunctive  query  operations. </p>

<h3>User Preferences using Possibilistic Networks</h3>
<p>Possibility theory is an uncertainty theory devoted to the handling of incomplete information. To a large extent, it is comparable to probability theory because it is based on set-functions. Further, possibilistic networks are the counterpart of Bayesian networks in the possibilistic setting. Possibilistic networks have only been studied and developed from a reasoning-under-uncertainty point of view until now. Dubois et al advocated their interest in preference modeling. Beyond their graphical appeal, they can be shown to provide a natural encoding of preferences
agreeing with the inclusion-based partial order applied to the subsets of preferences violated in the different situations. Moreover they do not encounter the limitations of CP-Nets in terms of representation capabilities. They also enjoy a logical counterpart that may be used for consistency checking.</p>

<p>In this project, we extend the technique of using CP-nets and focus on incorporating user preferences using Possibilistic Networks and handling uncertainty at the same time to answer k-rank queries.  </p>
